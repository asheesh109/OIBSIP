🏦 ATM Interface & 🎯 Quiz Game System

This repository contains two Java-based projects developed as part of my internship at Oasis Infobyte . These projects demonstrate my ability to design, develop, and integrate Java applications with MySQL databases using JDBC.

 📌 Project Overview

 ✅ 1. ATM Interface
A banking system simulation that allows users to:
- Authenticate using credentials
- Check account balance
- Withdraw, deposit, and transfer funds
- View transaction history
- Store and retrieve data using a MySQL database

 ✅ 2. Quiz Game
An interactive quiz application that:
- Presents multiple-choice questions
- Tracks user scores
- Ensures smooth user interaction through a structured Java program
- Uses a database to store and retrieve quiz questions

 🛠 Setup Instructions

1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/asheesh109/OIBSIP.git
cd OIBSIP 

2️⃣ Import the Project into IntelliJ IDEA
Open IntelliJ IDEA and select Open.
Navigate to the project folder and open it.

3️⃣ Set Up the Database
Import the database using the provided .sql files:
mysql -u root -p < ATM.sql
mysql -u root -p < Quiz.sql
Ensure MySQL is installed and running.

4️⃣ Run the Project
Compile and execute the Java files inside the src folder.

📜 Technologies Used
Java (JDK 17+) – Core programming language
MySQL – Database for storing ATM transactions and quiz data
JDBC – Connecting Java application to the database
Git & GitHub – Version control and project management
IntelliJ IDEA – Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

🎯 Internship Learning Outcomes
This project helped me gain hands-on experience in:

Java Application Development: Implementing core Java concepts, OOP principles, and exception handling.
Database Integration: Connecting Java with MySQL using JDBC and executing SQL queries.
Problem-Solving & Debugging: Identifying and fixing issues in real-time applications.
Version Control (Git & GitHub): Managing and tracking project changes efficiently.
